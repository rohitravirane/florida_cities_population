# florida_cities_population
florida_cities_population project is based on web. I used BeautifulSoup Python library for getting florida's cities ranks basis of 
their population data from 'https://www.florida-demographics.com/cities_by_population'. After getting data, we need to organize 
data for creating a CSV file by importing csv library to write a CSV file which is in data directory. After all we used pandas
library to read CSV and organize CSV. Finally, User type a rank of a specific city for finding a cities names and their 
population.
